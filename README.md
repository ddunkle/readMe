# README Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to develop a good ReadMe generator.  

## Resources used
Inquirer

## Future goals
Personally, I am really bad at styling and making something look good. If I had more time, I would try to make the site look better on a smaller device, as well as clean up the general visual appeal. I would also incorporate more of the data we get back from the API call, to better inform the user. 

Another stretch goal would be to allow the user to remove a single city from the saved city list.
